This is a Ninja forms extension to change the default content type header on a [Webhook](https://ninjaforms.com/extensions/webhooks/) from `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` to `application/json`.

You'll need to apply this script to be able to work with [Microsoft Flow](http://flow.microsoft.com) or [Azure Logic Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps)
